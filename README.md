# EVM block explorer

![EVM Block Explorer](https://icp.ninja/examples/_attachments/evm_block_explorer.png)

The EVM Block Explorer example demonstrates how an ICP smart contract can obtain information directly from other blockchain networks. Using HTTPS outcalls, smart contracts on ICP can interact with other networks without needing to go through a third-party service such as a bridge or an oracle. Supported interactions with other chains include querying network data, signing transactions, and submitting transactions directly to other networks.
In this example, you'll also see how to sign transactions with canister ECDSA or Schnorr signatures.

This application's logic is written in [Motoko](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/main/getting-started/motoko-introduction), a programming language designed specifically for developing canisters on ICP.


## Project structure

The `/backend` folder contains the Motoko canister, `app.mo`. The `/frontend` folder contains web assets for the application's user interface. The user interface is written using the React framework. Edit the `mops.toml` file to add [Motoko dependencies](https://mops.one/) to the project.
